[ WARN ] Imported library 'G:\My Drive\Python\Scraper\Lelongtips\sherlock-dms\resources\TransactionFormula.py' contains no keywords.
G:\My Drive\Python\Scraper\Lelongtips\sherlock-dms\resources\restAPI\Main\Main.py:899: GuessedAtParserWarning: No parser was explicitly specified, so I'm using the best available HTML parser for this system ("lxml"). This usually isn't a problem, but if you run this code on another system, or in a different virtual environment, it may use a different parser and behave differently.

The code that caused this warning is on line 899 of the file G:\My Drive\Python\Scraper\Lelongtips\sherlock-dms\resources\restAPI\Main\Main.py. To get rid of this warning, pass the additional argument 'features="lxml"' to the BeautifulSoup constructor.

  parsed_html = BeautifulSoup(body_text)
